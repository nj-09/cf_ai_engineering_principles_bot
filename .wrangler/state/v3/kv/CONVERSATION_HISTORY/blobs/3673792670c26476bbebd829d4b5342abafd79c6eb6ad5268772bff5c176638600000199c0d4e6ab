[{"role":"user","content":"What is a CDN?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"**Technical Definition:**\nA Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a distributed network of servers and caches that deliver web content, such as HTML pages, images, videos, and other files, to users more quickly and efficiently. CDNs work by storing copies of content at edge locations around the world, which reduces the distance between users and the content they request, resulting in faster load times and improved user experience.\n\n**Engineering Principles:**\nAt Cloudflare, we understand the importance of delivering high-performance content to our users. Our CDN is designed to ensure that users receive the content they need, when they need it, without compromising on speed or reliability. By caching content at the edge, we reduce the latency associated with traditional centralized content delivery methods, which means our users can access the content they want, faster. This aligns with our engineering principle of Performance, as we prioritize delivering fast and reliable experiences to our users. Additionally, our CDN is designed to scale with our users' needs, which ensures that our infrastructure can handle the demands of a rapidly growing user base, aligning with our engineering principle of Scale. By prioritizing performance, reliability, and scalability, we're able to deliver a superior user experience that sets us apart from the competition."},{"role":"user","content":"Now explain it to me like I'm five."},{"role":"assistant","content":"So, you know how sometimes you want to watch a video or play a game on the internet?
